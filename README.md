# Data-science-ML-and-EDA-Project
IN this repostiory we will see two project

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
Some common tools and libraries used in EDA include Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as well as software such as Tableau and Excel.
Overall, EDA is an important step in the data analysis process that can help reveal important insights and guide further analysis.



2.  # Supervised Machine Learning for Predictive Modeling":

we'll learn how to use Python's Scikit-Learn library for machine learning to create regression models. Specifically, we'll start by exploring simple linear regression, which involves just two variables."

## SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ▶  
  This regression task involves predicting the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied. It can be classified as a simple linear regression task as it involves the analysis of two variables only.

**TO PROJECT:** 
  Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
